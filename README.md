# Practical Machine Learning

This is my project for the "Practical Machine Learning" class offered by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health through Coursera.

The report that describes my approach is in the `Report.Rmd` (R Markdown version) and Report.html (HTML version) files. The source code is in the `source/Project.R` file.
